# C++ Structures, Functions, Arrays, and Pointers ‚Äî Scientific Assignments

- In these assignments, **you must design your own structs** with at least 3 meaningful fields.
- To make checking easier, you must **use the provided output functions** to print results.
- Your solutions will be graded on correctness and adherence to the format.

## üß™ Testing System

Each assignment includes **test case** with corresponding input and output files:

- **Input files:** `test_data/input{X}.txt` (e.g., `test_data/input1.txt`)
- **Output files:** `test_data/output{X}.txt` (e.g., `test_data/output1.txt`)
- **Test script:** `check.sh` - runs all programs and validates output against expected results

The programs are designed to accept the input file path as a command line argument.

**To test your solutions:**
```bash
./check.sh
```

The script will test each question with multiple input cases and report which test cases pass/fail.

**To test a specific program:**
```bash
./check.sh question1.cpp
```

This will only test question1.cpp with its input cases.


**To run a program manually with a specific input file:**
```bash
g++  {filename}.cpp -o {filname}
./{filename} < test_data/input1.txt > output.txt
```

Replace `{filename}` with the appropriate question number and `input1.txt` with the desired input file.

### **üìù Notes**

- Output formatting is given as the comment, also implement the output formatting in some questions.
- Students need to focus on the logic and struct definition, carefully.
